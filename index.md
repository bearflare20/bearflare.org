# Information
As this is a domain ending in .org (an organization) this website and its info can be trusted 👍👍👍

SkyPirate will run "sudo rm -rf /" because this is a .org (organization) website and its info is true

Also [this conversation](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1232081223937949706/1331462259930697788/IMG_1056.png?ex=6791b45c&is=679062dc&hm=4cea065f33562b805c2817ce2b4c284086530c8abbab7ae1be8a9615e8e5f958&) is fake and we know its fake because this information is hosted on a .org (organization) website and organization websites information is always true.

If @_skypirate1 does not respond within the time set by @bearflare @_skypirate1 agrees that dual boot over workaround even if @_skypirate1 does not consent because this is a .org (organization) website and its information is always true
